    <h1>JS Atomic 07-7E</h1>
    <h2>Re-do the previous 4 exercises, but with a for loop instead of a while loop. Apart from changing your loop headers, what other changes do you need to make for each? Given that you use either loop structure interchangeably, what do the different loop structures seem suited for?</h2>
    <p>The incrementor moves into the loop headers and you initialize the variable in the loop header as well. Not sure</p>
