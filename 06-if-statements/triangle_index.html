    <h1>JS Atomic 06-Triangle</h1>
    
    <h2>What happens if one (or more) of the lengths aren't input correctly and thus end up as NaN?</h2>
    <p>Doesn't add properly.  Needed to add conditional for isNaN.</p>
    
    <h2>What happens if one of the lengths of the triangle is 0? Two of the lengths? All three lengths?</h2>
    <p>No issues</p>
    
    <h2>What happens if the user inputs one or more negative integers for the lengths of the triangle's legs?</h2>
    <p>Still works but shouldn't. Added conditional to test input.</p>
