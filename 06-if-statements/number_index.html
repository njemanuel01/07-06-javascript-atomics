    <h1>JS Atomic 06-Number</h1>
    
    <h2>If you collect the user's input as a string (i.e. without using parseInt() to turn it into an integer), does == work to compare the input to the stored secret number? Would === work? Which is best?</h2>
    <p>Yes. No.  I guess it would depend if the numeric value mattered (ex. like you were going to add/sub. from it)</p>
    
    <h2>If you collect the user's input as an integer (i.e. by using parseInt() to turn it into an integer), can you use == to compare? ===? Which is better in this case?</h2>
    <p>You can use both, === would be better becuase it is more accurate.</p>
    
    <h2>What is the difference between == and ===?</h2>
    <p>== tests value, === tests value and type</p>
    
    <h2>In this case, does it make more sense to leave the user's guess as a string, or to convert it to an integer? Why? What are the relative advantages / disadvantages of each approach (particularly in terms of the types of new features that might be able to be added)?</h2>
    <p>I would leave it as a string since you're not doing anything to the numeric value</p>
