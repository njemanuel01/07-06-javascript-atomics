    <h1>JS Atomic 06-Driver1</h1>
    
    <h2>Does it matter what order your if-statements are in?</h2>
    <p>No.</p>
    
    <h2>When testing ranges, did you use &&, ||, or something else entirely (e.g. nested if-statements)? If you used &&, why is that a better choice than || (and vice-versa)?</h2>
    <p>Used &&.  More restrictive.</p>
    
    <h2>What types of input produce a value of NaN after parsing? Is it important to check for NaN values? Is it possible for a NaN value to trigger any of the other if-statements? If so, how and why?</h2>
    <p>Strings that don't start with a number.  Yes.  No.</p>
    
    <h2>What questions do you have?</h2>
    <p></p>
