  <h1>JS Atomic 02</h1>

  <h2>What's the difference between alert() and console.log()?</h2>
  <p>Alert outputs to a new window in the browser, console outputs to the console window.</p>

  <h2>What's one situation where you might use an `alert()` to tell the user something?</h2>
  <p>In the case where input is no of the correct type.</p>

  <h2>What's one way that `alert()` might get obnoxious?</h2>
  <p>As a user, you'd have to constantly be closing windows when the alert sounds.</p>

  <h2>Would it make sense to use console.log() to tell the user things? Why or why not?</h2>
  <p>No, because most users wouldn't check the console window</p>

  <h2>What's one way that console.log() might be a good tool for you to use?</h2>
  <p>It would be a nice way to check and see if the value of certain elements are what you expect them to be, as a debugging tool</p>

  <h2>When do the console.log() statements get run? Is it before the first alert() gets displayed? After it gets displayed but before the user clicks "OK" (or equivalent)? After the user clicks to close the dialog box? A different time? How did you find out for sure?</h2>
  <p>After the user clicks Okay.  Checked by having the console window open while refreshing the page.</p>
  
  <h2>What questions do you have?</h2>
  <p>What is the purpose of the console window?  What is it's history?</p>
