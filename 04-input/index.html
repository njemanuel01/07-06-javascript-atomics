    <h1>JS Atomic 04</h1>
    
    <h2>What is the data-type (e.g. string or integer) of the information that comes in? What happens if the user inputs a number -- does it stay an integer? Use typeof and console.log() to help with this.</h2>
    <p>Everything comes in as a string.</p>
    
    <h2>What happens if the user clicks "OK" (or equivalent) without typing anything in? What information gets assigned to a variable, if any?</h2>
    <p>The value is an empty string</p>
    
    <h2>How did you choose your variable names? If you gave a list of variable names to someone who hasn't seen your code, could they reasonably predict what information you might store in each?</h2>
    <p>The names describe the information stored in the variable</p>
    
    <h2>If you completely changed a question you were asking the user, would it make sense to totally rename the variable? What if you changed the order of your questions?</h2>
    <p>Yes, since the variable name is associated with the expected outcome of the question.  The order of the questions does not matter.</p>
    
    <h2>In these exercises, we use prompt() to collect information, but most websites do that ask for information do not use prompt() -- how do they collect information (what HTML elements do they use)? What might be an advantage to doing it that way instead of with prompt()? Are there any disadvantages? Why might you use prompt()?</h2>
    <p>They use an html "form." The advantage being the data can then be stored in the database using back-end programming.  The disadvantages are that it's not immediately available.  Prompt allows for quick access for some information that may not need to be stored.</p>
    
    <h2>Research prompt() -- is there any way to make it so that there are two (or more) fields?</h2>
    <p>Only by creating it, it does not have multiple fields by default.</p>
    
    <h2>What questions do you have?</h2>
    <p>How do I convert "prompt" data to an integer?</p>
