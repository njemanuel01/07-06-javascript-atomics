    <h1>JS Atomic 05</h1>
    
    <h2>What happens when you try to parse the integer out of a string like "Error 404"? How about "404 Error"? Other combinations of numbers and letters? What needs to be true about the incoming string for it to be parsed correctly?</h2>
    <p>Error 404 returns NaN "Not a number." The incoming string must be a number or start with a number.</p>
    
    <h2>What happens if one (or more) of the inputs are non-numeric text (like a comma or a dollar-sign)? What errors occur, if any? What does the console output tell you?</h2>
    <p>NaN occurs.</p>
    
    <h2>Why might you use the increment (++) or decrement (--) operators? What are some applications that you predict might come into play?</h2>
    <p>You might use them to increment in a loop.</p>
    
    <h2>What questions do you have?</h2>
    <p></p>
    
    <h2>Learn about the compound assignment operators (like += and -=) -- what problem do these solve and how are they used? What are situations where you might use a compound assignment operator instead of simple assignment (with =)? Which is easier to read: x += 2; or x = x + 2;?</h2>
    <p>They can be used when iterating by a value that is not 1.  For example, incrementing over the even numbers from 2-100.  Seems easier to me to use the operator than "=", it makes it easier to identify it as an increment.</p>
    
    <h2>Research the Javascript Math Object -- can you get some of these methods to work? I'll recommend Math.pow(), Math.max(), and Math.abs() as starting points.</h2>
    <p>Use .pow, .max, and .abs</p>
