  <h2>Given what you know so far, what are some reasons to use variables?</h2>
  <p>Variables are useful when data needs to be maleable or repeated.</p>
  
  <h2>What are some advantages to variable names like hairColor instead of hc (for example)? What are some disadvantages?</h2>
  <p>The advantages to descriptive naming of variables is that when you go back to a program, it's easier to know what a variable is doing when it's name is descriptive.  It does take time to type out and think of names.</p>
  
  <h2>Given what you know so far, what can you predict about other ways we might use variables?</h2>
  <p>Variables could be assigned to a number of things.  Cursor position, status of elements on a website. etc.</p>
  
  <h2>Why don't you need to use the var keyword every time you use a variable (right now, we only use it when we create the variable)? What does var do?</h2>
  <p>Declaring the variable makes it available for the rest of the script</p>
  
  <h2>What happens if you try to do output with a variable without first assigning a value to that variable? What happens? Does the program still work as intended? Do error messages show up in the console? If so, what error message?</h2>
  <p>"Undefined" is used as the value of an unassigned variable.  If the variable is undeclared, it gets an error message.</p>
  
  <h2>What questions do you have?</h2>
